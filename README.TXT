Project Goals
   - Simple open source video surveilance software.
   - Onvif, 4K, H.264, H.265, mu-law, AAC (latm & generic), b-frames
   - Linux & Windows
   - Software should run on almost anything (desktop, server, raspberry pi, etc...) and scale its
     capabilities automatically.
   - Pre Allocated Storage
       - Select the number of days of retention you want for a camera and all the disk space is
         allocated up front (and never exceeded).

What exists
   - onvif discovery
   - gstreamer rtsp based stream ingestions (h.264, h.265, MuLaw, ALaw, AAC, G.726)
   - recording (and query)
   - rtsp restreaming
   - basic recording GUI

TODO SOON
   - Analytics
       - Add UI dialog for motion detection
           - Maybe just a checkbox on an existing dialog do motion [x]
           - set do_motion_detection and motion_detection_file_path on r_camera during camera setup
           - Modify camera setup to finally create the r_ring motion file (if box was checked)
           - Use the byterate + recording file size to estimate seconds of recording they need and then size the motion data buffer based on that.
       - Modify recording_context to only send keys if r_camera::do_motion_detection is true
       - Modify motion data to be 3 bytes (motion, avg_motion, stddev) plumb it through to motion engine
       - Modify motion engine to actually write motion data to r_ring
       - Implement motion event query mechanism
   - Viewer
       - Cross platform QT Viewer
       - CRAZY fast + tons of keyboard shortcuts + super minimal UI
       - Pop up analytic event notifications
   - r_codec
       - r_audio_encoder
       - r_audio_decoder

Compiling on Linux

   To prepare a fresh Linux Mint 20.3 VM for compilation:
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
      <install virtualbox guest additions> Note: Configure your VM to have a decent amount of vram.
      sudo apt install git cmake
      sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev
      sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio libgstrtspserver-1.0-* libxml2-dev
      sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev
      git clone https://github.com/dicroce/revere
      cd revere
      mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

Compiling on Windows
