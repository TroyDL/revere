Project Goals
   - Simple open source video surveilance software.
   - Onvif, 4K, H.264, H.265, mu-law, AAC (latm & generic), b-frames
   - Linux & Windows
   - Software should run on almost anything (desktop, server, raspberry pi, etc...) and scale its capabilities automatically.
   - Pre Allocated Storage
       - Select the number of days of retention you want for a camera and all the disk space is allocated up front (and never exceeded).

TODO
   - r_disco
       - Add muxed file query API
       - Add jpg API
   - Viewer
       - Cross platform QT Viewer
       - CRAZY fast + tons of keyboard shortcuts + super minimal UI
       - Pop up analytic event notifications
   - Analytics
       - key frame motion detection
       - Triggers blob Tracking
       - Triggers object detection
       - Schedule aware analytic triggers (txt messages, UI notifications, etc)

Known Issues
    - Removing camera from Recording list it doesn't re-appear in discovered for a while. Axis cameras
      dont return for a long time (i think because our discovery code uses the same guid on subsequent runs).
    - _decode_frame() segfault accessing as.sdp_media["video"] map when key doesn't exist.
    - Put in invalid password. Should error out.
    - We should have a warning for extremely high bitrate cameras
    - 401 Unauthorized when occurring with camera setup should be visible to user somehow.
    - It will currently let you configure a record file with more space than the disk has free right now.
    - Support G.726 audio

Compiling on Linux

   To prepare a fresh Linux Mint 20.3 VM for compilation:
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install -y build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)
      <install virtualbox guest additions> Note: Configure your VM to have a decent amount of vram.
      sudo apt install git cmake
      sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev
      sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio libgstrtspserver-1.0-* libxml2-dev
      sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev
      git clone https://github.com/dicroce/revere
      cd revere
      mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

Compiling on Windows
